          <h2 class="subtitle">Overview</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">StillFresh is an app providing service for eco-minded, start-up hotels/restaurants and individuals or third-party non-profit organizations to easily manage, acquire and trade leftover food. The platform will bring a smooth repurposing flow from ordering, communication, to pick up. </p>
        </div>

        <!-- discover problem section -->
        <div class="row-box">
          <h2 class="subtitle">Discovering the Problem</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">​Hotel buffets would usually prepare more food than what the guest actually takes. However, based on our research, <strong> only 50% of the food would be actually consumed</strong>. Among that surplus food, only 10 to 15 percent will be reallocated due to food safety regulations. A big portion of the leftovers are actually edible and could be repurposed. While some people or third-party organizations, like low-income families or charities who are looking for low priced food and others are trying to reallocate surplus food to reduce their financial loss.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- opportunity section -->
        <div class="row-box">
          <h2 class="subtitle">Opportunity</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">Currently, there are <strong> not many effective ways to reduce food waste.</strong> The existing process of donating and repurposing is ineffective, due to food safety regulation and inefficient communication. Many foods ended up in the garbage because they have become stale before being relocated or they were eaten by others. There are many people looking for food and also many are trying to reallocate food. There are not many effective ways to connect them together. <br>
          <br>
          To solve this problem, we are proposing StillFresh, a platform that provides services for both hotels and individuals to manage and acquire leftover food at more than 70% off of the original price. The app will bring a smooth re-purposing flow from ordering to delivery. By connecting two stakeholders, it could help to reduce food waste at the hotel and restaurant service. </p>

          <p class="paragraph">Our target audiences are <strong> eco-minded, start-up hotels/restaurants who would like to sell their surplus food to reduce financial loss</strong>. And <strong> individuals or third party organizations (food banks, charities, etc.) who need decent edible food with discounted price</strong>. We created a persona based upon our user research to better understand our target user’s goals and needs.</p>

          <h2 class="subtitle">Initial Design</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">Initial we had two types of the target audience - food provider (hotels/restaurants) and food receiver (charities/food banks),  we understand that the charity/food bank needs a large amount of low priced decent food. Thus, we designed the portion sizes in grams. Also, since the app is aiming to promote the leftover food, we want to highlight the food rather than the restaurant. Thus, on the product listing page giving big images of food on a clear background, this can avoid user judging the food by the image background environment. </p>

        <div class="row-box">
          <h2 class="subtitle">User Testing</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">Once the first version of prototypes was completed, we conduct a think-aloud usability test, then iterate upon the prototype with the feedback. Here is some feedback we received:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Simplify the interface of the profile page</li>
            <li>Revise the unit or find a better way to count food</li>
            <li>Hierarchy issues of the "categories bar"</li>
            <li>Add a donate leftovers option to help homeless</li>
            <li>Add an own menu page for each hotel/restaurant</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="paragraph">Based on our further research, some food banks are reluctant to receive leftovers from the buffet because it isn't properly packaged. Also, after the user testing, we realized that individuals are willing to get decent leftovers, so we consider and emphasize individual as part of our target audience. We then repeated the process of testing and applied feedback one more time until we had created our final design for the applications' user interface.

          <h2 class="subtitle">Reflection</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Through this project, I learned how much a product can transform from its original idea. Our initial idea was to build a B2B platform that intends to save leftover food, allow organizations (charities, food banks) to receive products of equal quality from hotels/restaurants at a discounted price. However, in our further research, we noticed that not every food bank distributes cooked meals, while we wanted the app to solve the issue of leftovers and bring benefits to the community. Lack of research at the early stage, lead us had to take a step back to reconsider its purpose. The feedback from our peers and instructors is crucial for us and made us rethink and integrate design features. <br>
            <br>
            For future development, I would like to add a section for "free donation". Since this app is for commercial use, we can't simply add the "free item" option as people might take advantage of it, and this might change the purpose of the app. Therefore, this still needs to have more research to consider how to combine the section together.
